Wix Angular Seed
=========

Wix Angular Seed is a client-side environment built upon the AngularJS framework that lets you write expressive, readable
and testable web applications for the Wix App Market. As a client-side solution, you are free to choose your server-side
solution as you see fit ([our Symfony2 bundle is recommended](https://github.com/ranm8/WixFrameworkBundle)) and communicate
in a RESTful manner between your client and your server. It features a simple way to integrate deep linking into your Wix
application by always keeping your application state synchronized with Wix. It allows you to easily create links to your
backend (whether it's a Symfony2 backend, a plain PHP backend or any different backend) that includes Wix specific information
so that your backend can have access to it. It also enhances Wix's SDK to make it easier to work with.

By the nature of Wix applications, they require you to have a very rich and engaging client-side for your users. For this
reason, the Wix Angular Seed comes bundled with two extra modules: a UI module that integrates popular plugins into AngularJS
to allow you to easily create color-pickers, date-pickers, accordions, dialogs and more. The second module is a text extension
that help you truncate strings, wordwrap paragraphs and mroe.

On top of that the Wix Angular Seed includes .sass files required to create the feeling of an amazing Wix application.
You can choose to use it as it is to quickly make your application look like a Wix application should or you can extend it
to match it to your exact needs.
